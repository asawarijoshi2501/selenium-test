<p> I learned that this course teaches lots of devops and CI/ CD pipeline stuff. I was not aware of it in the beginning of the course but now I am more familiar with how this course is designed and what we are supposed to learn out of this, github is a good platform to start learning about CI/CD and devops toolchain.
